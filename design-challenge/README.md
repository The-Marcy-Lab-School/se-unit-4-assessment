# OO Design Challenge

## Directions
You are to design and implement an object oriented To-Do List using ES6 `class` syntax. Think about all the To-Do Lists you've ever create in real life. What behaviors does it have? 

Your implementation should be able to (but is not limited to):
* store todo items
* add items to your To-Do List
* remove or mark-as-complete items

You should have complete, working code, utilizing at least one ES6 class. **You must test your class or classes by instantiating new instances and calling methods** to ensure that data flows through your model as you would expect it to.

If you want some inspiration, play around with [this simple to-do list app](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo/blob/master/index.html) and use it as a model for your classes.

Write your solution in `todo.js`.
