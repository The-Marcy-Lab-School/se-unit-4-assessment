# OO Design Challenge

## Directions
You are to design and implement an object oriented To-Do List. A to-do list is significantly less complex than a social network like Instagram or a game like Blackjack. Thus, this should be less intensive than the activities we've done as a group.

Thus, I expect for a complete, working model. Test your classes by instantiating new objects and calling methods to ensure that data flows through your model as you would expect it to.

If you want some inspiration, play around with [this simple to-do list app](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo/blob/master/index.html) and use it as a model for your classes.

Write your solution in `todo.js`.
