# Unit 4 Assessment
## Object Oriented JavaScript

### Directions
This exam has three sections:
  1. Short Response
  2. Coding Exercises
  3. Design Challenge

You have 210 minutes to complete this assessment. Complete each section to the best of your abilities. Like in the real world, you may use your notes, documentation, Stack Overflow, or Google. The only resource that I ask you not to use is your neighbor. Though, your teammates often the best resources you can find on the job, today, I'm looking to learn your individual mastery so that I can better support you going forward.

DM me on Slack if you have any questions or come across any bugs or typos!

Good luck! ‚úåüèæ
